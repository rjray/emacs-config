;;; utils.el --- Utility functions.

;;; Commentary:

;;; Basic utility functions, most of which were obtained elsewhere. None of
;;; these should be directly bound to keys (those belong in keys-functions.el).
;;; These should only be things like support code for hooks, menu
;;; functionality, etc. Calls to "add-hook" or "add-submenu" are OK here (as
;;; opposed to hooks.el or misc.el) as long as they only refer to
;;; functionality defined here.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl)
