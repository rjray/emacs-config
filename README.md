# Emacs Config

This is a split off of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/rjray/dotfiles) repo,
for just the emacs configuration.

This allows me to install the emacs config in places where I might not need
the full set of dot-files, or install the dot-files on systems that don't
have emacs.

### Submodules

A large part of what is here is in git submodules, see the file
<kbd>.gitmodules</kbd>. Each sub-directory (except one, see next section)
under <kbd>.emacs.d</kbd> is a git submodule.

### Other People's Code

The directory <kbd>.emacs.d/other-peoples-code</kbd> contains files that I've
copied in whole from other places. See the comments in those files for their
source. (In some cases, I couldn't find the original source.)
